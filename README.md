# Object Detection Module - Aeye
I build this library from [sgrvinod's](https://github.com/sgrvinod) awesome [Pytorch Tutorial to Object Detection](https://github.com/sgrvinod/a-PyTorch-Tutorial-to-Object-Detection) and was packaged for use in Aeye.

You can install it using pip

```
$ pip install ObjectDetection-aeye
```
